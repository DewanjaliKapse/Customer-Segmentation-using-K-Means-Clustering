# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a crucial technique in marketing that allows businesses to group their customers based on similar characteristics and behaviors. In this project, K-Means clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, was utilized to analyze and segment customers based on their purchasing patterns. The primary objective was to identify distinct customer groups that could be targeted with personalized marketing strategies, thereby enhancing customer engagement and driving sales. This project involved preprocessing the data, applying the K-Means algorithm, and visualizing the results to gain actionable insights into customer behavior.

## Technology Used
1. **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and model implementation.
2. **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.
3. **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library for preprocessing and managing data.
4. **Matplotlib**: Visualization library used to plot the clusters and centroids.
5. **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations, used for handling arrays and matrices during data processing.

## Dataset Used
- **Dataset Name**: Mall Customers Dataset
- **Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python
- **Description**: The dataset contains information about customers of a mall, including features like Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. These features were used to cluster customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and spending patterns.
